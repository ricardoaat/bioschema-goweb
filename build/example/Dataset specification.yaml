  description: |-
    A technique or technology used in a Dataset (or DataDownload, DataCatalog), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (described using variableMeasured). This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but rather as a high level summary for dataset discovery.
    For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence".
    If the variableMeasured is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".
    If there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValuefor each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique.
