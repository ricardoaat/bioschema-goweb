  expected_types:
  - PropertyValue
  description: |-
    A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.

    Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width, http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic property/value mechanism.
  type: ""
  type_url: ""
  bsc_description: Whenever possible, please use a property coined in a third-party
    well-know vocabulary. For instance, you can directly use http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002327
    as a property to express how a protein or gene enables some GO molecular function.
    If you still want or need to use additionalProperty, please use (i) property name
    to specify the name of the property, (ii) additionalType (if possible) to better
    specify the nature of the property, and (iii) value to link to the object/range
    of this property.

  description: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.
