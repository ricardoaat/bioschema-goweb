  subtitle: Bioschemas specification for describing Samples in the life-science
  description: To deliver on the identified use cases for samples, we have identified
    a minimal set of properties to encapsulate identification, linking, and metadata
    descriptions. Some of these properties are existing standard schema.org properties,
    others require Bioschemas extensions. Table 1 outlines the minimal set of properties
    for the ‘Sample’ concept and Table 2 shows our recommendations for use of the
    ‘PropertyValue’ concept to markup additional characteristics of a sample described
    within a sample page. We also propose a new concept, ‘Biomedical Code’, which
    is a generalisation of the existing ‘Medical Code’ concept defined in the health-lifesci.schema.org
    extension.

    is no matching property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware that applications
    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.'
